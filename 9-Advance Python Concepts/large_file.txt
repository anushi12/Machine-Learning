When the Sunlight touched my face, 
and the walls brushed with it's rays, 
rise of new day and morning,
filled with timeless music and my soft tone voice, 
echoed around the house, 
preparing brushetta and green tea.
Wrapping myself inside the duvet,
and sipping while reading 'The Black Dress',
every moment feels undeniably beautiful.What a beautiful day it is!
Sunday morning's are special at it purest form,
Nothing can be better than sitting outdoor and take some time to glance into self.
